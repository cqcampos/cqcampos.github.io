In the Spring quarter, I co-teach a graduate Topics in Labor Economics (33918) course with Jack Mountjoy and Matt Notowidigdo. I cover topics related to Discrimination and the Economics of K-12 Education. The course content is on Canvas. If you are interested in the lecture slides, send me an email and I am glad to share.
