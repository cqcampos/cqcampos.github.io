I am an Assistant Professor of Economics and John E. Jeuck Faculty Fellow at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I am also a Faculty Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). My research uses a combination of experimental, quasi-experimental, and structural methods to study the economics of education, with an emphasis on how the design of education markets shapes outcomes.

Before pursuing higher education, I served in the United States Marine Corps and served tours in Iraq and Southeast Asia. I received my PhD in Economics from UC Berkeley in 2021 and spent one year as a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Industrial Relations Section at Princeton University.
