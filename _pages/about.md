I am a labor economist currently focusing on the economics of education.  Before pursuing higher education, I served in the United States Marine Corps and served tours in Iraq and Southeast Asia. I received a BA in Economics and Statistics from the University of California, San Diego, and an MA in Statistics from the University of California, Berkeley. I received my PhD in Economics from UC Berkeley in 2021.

I will join the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business as an Assistant Professor in 2022 after spending one year as an Industrial Relations Section Fellow at Princeton University.
