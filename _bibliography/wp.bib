  title={The Impact of Neighborhood School Choice: Evidence from Los Angeles' Zones of Choice},
  author={Campos, Christopher and Kearns, Caitlin},
  abstract={Does a public school district that expands school choice provide better outcomes for students than a neighborhood-based assignment system? Can public school choice systems produce competition that improves student outcomes? This paper answers these questions by studying the Zones of Choice program, a novel school choice initiative that created small high school markets in some neighborhoods but left traditional attendance-zone boundaries in place throughout the rest of the district. The policy design allows us to uniquely study market-level impacts of choice and the introduction of competition on student achievement and college enrollment using a difference-in-differences design. Our findings reveal that student outcomes in ZOC markets increased markedly, narrowing achievement and college-enrollment gaps between ZOC neighborhoods and the rest of the district.  These gains are largely explained by general improvements in school effectiveness rather than changes in student match quality. To explore the role of competition in driving these gains, we construct a competition index that leverages differences in school popularity and the spatial differentiation of students and schools at the program's onset. We demonstrate that the effects of ZOC are larger for schools exposed to more competition, supporting the notion that competition is a key channel through which ZOC  exerts its impacts. Demand estimates derived from rank-ordered-preference lists suggest families place substantial weight on schools' academic quality, and this weight provides schools with  competition-induced incentives to improve their effectiveness. Our findings demonstrate that public school choice programs have the potential to improve school quality, reduce neighborhood-based disparities in educational opportunity, and produce sustained improvements in student outcomes.},

  title={Independent Contracting, Self-Employment, and Gig Work: Evidence from California Tax Data},
  author={Bernhardt, Annette and Campos, Christopher and Prohofsky, Allen and Ramesh, Aparna and Rothstein, Jesse },
  abstract={We use de-identified data from California personal income tax returns to measure the frequency and nature of independent contracting work in California. We identify independent contractors by the presence of a Schedule C on the tax return and/or the receipt of a Form 1099 information return. We estimate that 14.4% of California workers aged 18-64 in tax year 2016 had some independent contracting income; over half of these do not have traditional jobs generating W-2s and get all of their earnings from independent contracting. Workers with low earnings are significantly more likely to earn independent contracting income and to rely primarily or exclusively on that income. We explore the characteristics of independent contractors and their distribution across family type, geography, and industry.},
