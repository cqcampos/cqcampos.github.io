  title={Social Interactions and Preferences for Schools: Experimental Evidence from Los Angeles},
  author={Campos, Christopher},
  abstract={This paper studies how parents' preferences for schools are affected by information about school and peer quality and how social interactions mediate changes in demand. I design an information intervention that cross-randomizes whether parents receive information about school quality (school value-added) and peer quality. Using a spillover design that varies the saturation of information across schools, I also randomize parents' proximity to other parents with similar information.  I find that the information leads to changes in parental preferences toward higher value-added schools, and this occurs when both parents and their neighbors receive information. These results imply substantial information spillovers. I complement this evidence with survey data on the distribution of beliefs over school and peer quality and conclude that the direct and spillover effects of my experiment come primarily from changes in parental preferences rather than an updating of parental beliefs in response to information. These findings show that when parents are informed about school and peer quality, their social interactions lead to changes in preferences in a way that rewards more effective schools.},

  title={Who Benefits from Remote Schooling? Self-selection and Match Effects},
  author={Bruhn, Jesse and Campos, Christopher and Chyn, Eric},
  abstract={We study the distributional effects of remote learning. Our approach combines newly collected data on parental preferences with administrative data from Los Angeles. The preference data allow us to account for selection into remote learning and isolate plausibly exogenous variation. We find that the average effect of remote learning is negative (-0.11$\sigma$ for reading; -0.13$\sigma$ for math). Notably, we also find evidence of positive learning effects for children whose parents have strong demand for remote learning. Our results suggest that some students currently sorting into post-pandemic remote learning benefit from expanded choice.},

  title={Decomposing the Gender Earnings Gap},
  author={Bucarey, Alonso and Campos, Christopher and Contreras, Dante and  Munoz, Pablo },
  abstract={This paper studies the interplay between preferences, gender return differentials, and centralized assignment in explaining the gender earnings gap among college graduates. Using rich data of rank-ordered lists from the Chilean centralized college admissions system coupled with a Roy-style framework, we decompose the within-major gender earnings gap into differences in the returns to different majors and differences in self-selection into majors. We find that most of the within-major earnings gap is due to differences in labor market returns for men and women majoring in the same fields, but we also find differences in self-selection patterns between men and women. Oaxaca-style decompositions show that most of the gap is due to differences in the representation of women in high-earning majors, with Engineering playing a significant role. We conclude with a counterfactual analysis that leverages the rules embedded in centralized assignment to assess the scope of differences policies. Our findings show that gender-specific quotas may serve as a feasible policy lever that increases the representation of women in high earnings field and substantially reduces the gender earnings gap among college graduates. },

  title={The Impact of Reducing Gender Biases in the Classroom: Evidence from Teacher and Student Based Interventions},
  author={Campos, Christopher and Martinez, Joan},
  abstract={Gender differences appear at early ages, with schools potentially pivotal in transmitting biases and stereotypes from teachers to students. This paper has four objectives. First, we document the extent of teacher and student gender biases before students finish secondary education and how these biases map to future educational aspirations. Second, we conduct a randomized control trial across 1,000 schools in Peru to study the relative effectiveness of student- and teacher-based interventions in reducing biases and affecting subsequent pre- and post-high school graduation trajectories. Our treatments involve the development of a rich curriculum about gender equality that aims to educate students about the detrimental effects of implicit and explicit gender biases. Third, and most importantly, we peek into the black box of gender bias fomentation and interpret our findings through the lens of malleable gender differences in risk preferences. The treatment effects we document map to a simple structural model that permits us to quantify whether risk preferences are malleable and how much of the overall treatment effects are captured by changes in risk preferences. Last, we assess whether teachers' gender attitudes are more (or less) malleable than students' and their repercussions for dwindling biases. Our intervention allows us to isolate how much differences in risk preferences contribute to the gender STEM gap and the potential impact future student- and teacher-based policies can have on eliminating that margin.},
