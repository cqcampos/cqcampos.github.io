  title={Who Benefits from Remote Schooling? Self-selection and Match Effects},
  author={Bruhn, Jesse and Campos, Christopher and Chyn, Eric},
  abstract={We study the distributional effects of remote learning. Our approach combines newly collected data on parental preferences with administrative data from Los Angeles. The preference data allow us to account for selection into remote learning and isolate plausibly exogenous variation. We find that the average effect of remote learning is negative (-0.11$\sigma$  for reading; -0.13$\sigma$  for math). Notably, we also find evidence of positive learning effects for children whose parents have strong demand for remote learning. Our results suggest that some students currently sorting into post-pandemic remote learning benefit from expanded choice.},

  title={Decomposing the Gender Earnings Gap},
  author={Bucarey, Alonso and Campos, Christopher and Contreras, Dante and  Munoz, Pablo },
  abstract={This paper studies the interplay between preferences, gender return differentials, and centralized assignment in explaining the gender earnings gap among college graduates. Using rich data of rank-ordered lists from the Chilean centralized college admissions system coupled with a Roy-style framework, we decompose the within-major gender earnings gap into differences in the returns to different majors and differences in self-selection into majors. We find that most of the within-major earnings gap is due to differences in labor market returns for men and women majoring in the same fields, but we also find differences in self-selection patterns between men and women. Oaxaca-style decompositions show that most of the gap is due to differences in the representation of women in high-earning majors, with Engineering playing a significant role. We conclude with a counterfactual analysis that leverages the rules embedded in centralized assignment to assess the scope of differences policies. Our findings show that gender-specific quotas may serve as a feasible policy lever that increases the representation of women in high earnings field and substantially reduces the gender earnings gap among college graduates. },

  title={Gender Stereotype Training Impacts on Labor Market Outcomes: Experimental Evidence},
  author={Campos, Christopher and Martinez, Joan},
  abstract={This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of a gender stereotype training program that seeks to reduce the impact of stereotypes on students' academic performance, career aspirations, and employment outcomes. The program will be implemented in over 500 high schools in Peru, with two treatment arms: a cognitive-emotional program and an actionable program that targets gender stereotypes directly affecting post-secondary trajectories. The study will evaluate the effects of the program on students' implicit and explicit stereotypes, aspirations, and preferences over careers and occupations. Additionally, the study will quantify to what extent risk-taking beliefs, self-confidence, and effort costs are malleable and contribute to the gender STEM gap. The findings will provide insights into how future student-based policies can eliminate the gender gap.},
