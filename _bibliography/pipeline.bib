  title={Returns to Fields of Study and the Gender Earnings Gap},
  author={Bucarey, Alonso and Campos, Christopher and Contreras, Dante and  Munoz, Pablo },
  abstract={This paper studies the interplay between preferences, gender return differentials, and centralized assignment in explaining the gender earnings gap among college graduates. Using rich data of rank-ordered lists from the Chilean centralized college admissions system coupled with a Roy-style framework, we decompose the within-major gender earnings gap into differences in the returns to different majors and differences in self-selection into majors. We find that most of the within-major earnings gap is due to differences in labor market returns for men and women majoring in the same fields, but we also find differences in self-selection patterns between men and women. Oaxaca-style decompositions show that most of the gap is due to differences in the representation of women in high-earning majors, with Engineering playing a significant role. We conclude with a counterfactual analysis that leverages the rules embedded in centralized assignment to assess the scope of differences policies. Our findings show that gender-specific quotas may serve as a feasible policy lever that increases the representation of women in high earnings field and substantially reduces the gender earnings gap among college graduates. },

  title={The Malleability of Gendered Ability Bias and its Labor Market Implications: Experimental Evidence},
  author={Campos, Christopher and Martinez, Joan},
  abstract={While laboratory evidence has documented that men and women differentially perceive their abilities with respect to gender-conforming tasks, there is scant evidence about how behavior in these controlled environments maps to the real world and if targeted interventions can mold these gender differences. We make progress along both fronts by studying the effects of a gender stereotype training program on job preferences among high school seniors that choose between internships that are analytically-oriented versus service-oriented. The intervention, which will be implemented in 250 Peruvian high schools, will provide students with cognitive-emotional content and actionable strategies to counteract gender stereotypes that distort their perception of their own abilities as gender-specific over an extended semester-long in-person course. By collecting rich survey data, we can quantify baseline and endline gender differences in perceived abilities with respect to gender-conforming tasks, whose malleability we aim to assess. Further linking the intervention to a job choice model enables us to estimate the moderating impact of objective and self-perceived differences in women's and men's abilities on the selection of gender-conforming jobs, documenting the implications of these differences on real-world outcomes. The findings provide insights into how future student-based policies can reduce gender gaps in the labor market.},
