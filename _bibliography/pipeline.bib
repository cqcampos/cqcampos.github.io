  title={Major Choice and Gender Gaps},
  author={Bucarey, Alonso and Campos, Christopher and Contreras, Dante and  Munoz, Pablo },
  abstract={This paper studies how college major returns, preferences, and market design contribute to gender gaps relevant to policy. To study why gender representation gaps exist in high-earning majors, we first leverage data on major preferences to show that majors causally affect both earnings and fertility, with notable cross-field heterogeneity and modest gender differences. We then find that monetary returns largely drive men's choice of major, while women prioritize family considerations. Our estimates suggest that 17-24% of the college gender earnings gap is due to these differing priorities, and we find suggestive evidence that variation in gender norm progressivity plays a prescriptive role in governing behavior. Finally, we evaluate policy alternatives that target representation gaps by simulating counterfactual scenarios within a centralized assignment system. Introducing small gender-based quotas modestly reduces the gender earnings gap without significantly affecting overall efficiency.},

  title={Parents' Beliefs and Valuations of Academic and Socio-Emotional School Effectiveness},
  author={Campos, Christopher and Neilson, Christopher},
  abstract={We design information modules that provide parents in Los Angeles with a rich environment to learn about different aspects of the school choice process. These include rich pedagogical lessons on school effectiveness, including academic and socio-emotional effectiveness. After teaching parents about the different dimensions of school effectiveness during in-person information sessions, we elicit their beliefs about schools in their choice set, experimentally estimate their beliefs about the production function, and experimentally estimate their preferences. Parents tend to underestimate both academic and socio-emotional effectiveness. Parents' beliefs about the production function of each vary, with teacher quality being more important for academic effectiveness but unimportant for socio-emotional effectiveness.  We find that parents tend to have approximately equal valuation over academic and socio-emotional effectiveness, underscoring the importance of the less-studied latter notion of school quality. Last, we simulate forthcoming school closure policies and quantify the welfare implications of policies that target only one aspect of quality.},
