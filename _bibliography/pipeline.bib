  title={Major Choice and Gender Gaps},
  author={Bucarey, Alonso and Campos, Christopher and Contreras, Dante and  Munoz, Pablo },
  abstract={This paper studies how college major returns, preferences, and market design contribute to gender gaps. We show that differences in major representation account for most of the gender earnings gap among college graduates and that college majors causally affect both earnings and fertility, with significant variation across fields of study but modest gender differences within fields. We also document that women place greater emphasis on balancing monetary returns and family considerations when choosing majors, and estimate that these differing priorities account for roughly 30% of the college gender earnings gap. Finally, we simulate counterfactual scenarios in a centralized assignment system to evaluate policies that can target representation gaps while taking students' preferences as given. We find that gender-based quotas would reduce gaps with minimal impacts on overall efficiency.},

  title={Who Chooses and Who Benefits? The Limits of Decentralized Choice},
  author={Bruhn, Jesse and Campos, Christopher and Chyn, Eric and Vazquez, Antonia},
  abstract={The majority of U.S. public school districts now offer school choice programs that allocate seats using a centralized algorithm but with voluntary participation. The optional nature of public school choice segments public education and raises critical questions: who chooses, who benefits, and what policy alternatives can produce better outcomes for children? This paper provides new evidence on these questions by studying the largest opt-in system in the country. Analyzing two decades of lottery records, we find that students living closer to choice options are both more likely to participate and to experience larger achievement gains. The proximity-based treatment effect heterogeneity is not explained by other observable treatment effect heterogeneity, suggesting a potential role for unobserved demand-side factors. To assess the empirical relevance of this hypothesis, we rely on quasi-experimental variation in distance to schools due to large expansions in choice programming and lottery-based admission lotteries to estimate a generalized Roy model that links families' decisions to apply and enroll to achievement gains. Our estimates indicate that the families least likely to apply under the current system would realize the largest test score benefits if they participated. In other words, decentralized, opt-in systems not only segment public education markets based on student ability and socioeconomic status but also exacerbate existing inequalities in educational outcomes. Policy interventions---such as targeted information interventions that cultivate broader participation or mandate participation as is done in cities such as New York---can produce sizable reductions in inequality. },

  title={Parents' Beliefs and Valuations of Academic and Socio-Emotional School Effectiveness},
  author={Campos, Christopher and Neilson, Christopher},
  abstract={We design information modules that provide parents in Los Angeles with a rich environment to learn about different aspects of the school choice process. These include rich pedagogical lessons on school effectiveness, including academic and socio-emotional effectiveness. After teaching parents about the different dimensions of school effectiveness during in-person information sessions, we elicit their beliefs about schools in their choice set, experimentally estimate their beliefs about the production function, and experimentally estimate their preferences. Parents tend to underestimate both academic and socio-emotional effectiveness. Parents' beliefs about the production function of each vary, with teacher quality being more important for academic effectiveness but unimportant for socio-emotional effectiveness.  We find that parents tend to have approximately equal valuation over academic and socio-emotional effectiveness, underscoring the importance of the less-studied latter notion of school quality. Last, we simulate forthcoming school closure policies and quantify the welfare implications of policies that target only one aspect of quality.},
