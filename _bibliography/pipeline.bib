  title={Major Choice and Gender Gaps},
  author={Bucarey, Alonso and Campos, Christopher and Contreras, Dante and  Munoz, Pablo },
  abstract={This paper studies how college major returns, preferences, and market design contribute to gender gaps relevant to policy. We leverage data on major preferences to show that majors significantly affect both earnings and fertility, with notable cross-field heterogeneity and modest gender differences in vertical and horizontal returns. Monetary returns largely drive men's choice of major, while women prioritize family considerations. Our estimates suggest that 27% of the college gender earnings gap is due to these differing priorities. We also document substantial variation in child penalty gaps across fields, finding that more progressive gender norms within a field are predictive of smaller gender gaps. Finally, we evaluate policy alternatives by simulating counterfactual scenarios within a centralized assignment system. Introducing small gender-based quotas modestly reduces the gender earnings gap without significantly affecting overall efficiency.},
