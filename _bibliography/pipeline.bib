  abstract={This paper studies the interplay between major return differences, preferences, and market design in explaining the gender earnings gap. Information on preferences---embedded in the rank-ordered lists submitted when applying to college through a centralized admissions system---allows us to estimate the returns to fields of study while accounting for selection on unobservables. We find that most of the gender gap among college graduates is due to differences in their representation across majors and that match effects play a modest role in explaining the within-major earnings gap. Against this backdrop, we consider policy-relevant counterfactuals leveraging the algorithmic rules embedded in a centralized assignment system. Our results suggest that slight gender-specific quotas can substantially reduce the gender earning gap among college graduates with minimal impact on efficiency. },
