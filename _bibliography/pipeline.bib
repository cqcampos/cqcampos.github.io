  title={Who Chooses and Who Benefits? The Limits of Decentralized Choice},
  author={Bruhn, Jesse and Campos, Christopher and Chyn, Eric and Vazquez, Antonia},
  abstract={Public school choice has expanded rapidly across U.S. districts, yet most rely on centralized assignment with voluntary, opt-in participation rather than mandatory universal enrollment. We study the consequences of this design in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), the nation's largest opt-in system. Using two decades of administrative records, oversubscribed admission lotteries, and quasi-experimental changes in school access, we report four findings. First, participants are disproportionately advantaged: applicants have higher baseline achievement and are less likely to be low-income. Second, lottery-based estimates show a strong negative proximity-based gradient in achievement effects. This proximity-based heterogeneity cannot be explained by observable treatment effect heterogeneity, pointing to unobserved demand factors. Third, to assess the empirical relevance of the association between demand and causal effects, we estimate a structural model of application, enrollment, and achievement using policy-induced variation in access to schools due to large expansions in the public school choice sector combined with lottery-based admissions for identification of the outcome model. We find corroborating evidence for negative selection on gains and further highlight high application costs and weak demand as central frictions. Importantly, the vertical differentiation of public school choice programs, shaped in part by charter competition, generates meaningful potential for achievement improvements. Finally, counterfactual policy analysis shows that reducing information frictions modestly broadens participation, but mandating participation produces substantial achievement gains by expanding access and filling unused capacity at effective schools. Together, these results suggest that expanding choice options marks progress, but whether choice improves outcomes depends on the details of market design: voluntary, decentralized systems limit the promise of school choice, while carefully structured assignment mechanisms can unlock broader benefits.},

  title={Parents' Beliefs and Valuations of Academic and Socio-Emotional School Effectiveness},
  author={Campos, Christopher and Neilson, Christopher},
  abstract={We design information modules that provide parents in Los Angeles with a rich environment to learn about different aspects of the school choice process. These include rich pedagogical lessons on school effectiveness, including academic and socio-emotional effectiveness. After teaching parents about the different dimensions of school effectiveness during in-person information sessions, we elicit their beliefs about schools in their choice set, experimentally estimate their beliefs about the production function, and experimentally estimate their preferences. Parents tend to underestimate both academic and socio-emotional effectiveness. Parents' beliefs about the production function of each vary, with teacher quality being more important for academic effectiveness but unimportant for socio-emotional effectiveness.  We find that parents tend to have approximately equal valuation over academic and socio-emotional effectiveness, underscoring the importance of the less-studied latter notion of school quality. Last, we simulate forthcoming school closure policies and quantify the welfare implications of policies that target only one aspect of quality.},

  title={Long Term Effects of Centralizing College Admissions: Evidence from Sequential Reforms in Finland},
  author={Barrios-Fernandez, Andres, and Campos, Christopher and Kaila, Marrti and Leppanen, Otto and Virkola, Tuomo},
  abstract={In higher education, how does the transition from a decentralized market to a centralized clearinghouse affect student outcomes? We study a series of reforms that gradually converted Finland’s higher education system, allowing us to hone in on the marginal effects of different aspects common in the centralization bundle. The first reform introduced a single application–a reform similar to the United State’s Common App–reducing application costs while preserving institution’s control over admissions. The centralization coda occurred six years later in a reform that centralized admissions and required applicants to submit rank-ordered lists. Exploiting birth‐date–based eligibility thresholds in a difference‐in‐discontinuities design, together with a difference‐in‐differences comparison across cohorts with varying exposure, we find that the first reform boosted application rates, expanded the diversity of programs students apply to, modestly increased college graduation rates, and boosted earnings by roughly 4 percent at age 28. The centralization coda led to mechanical reduction in total number of programs students apply to---via a list length limit---while changing the composition of application portfolios and improved graduation rates years later. These findings suggest that both application frictions and the adoption of algorithms that determine ``who gets what'' are equally important determinants of students' long-run labor market outcomes.},
