  title={Who Benefits from Remote Schooling? Self-selection and Match Effects},
  author={Bruhn, Jesse and Campos, Christopher and Chyn, Eric and Tran, Anh},
  abstract={We study the distributional effects of remote learning. Our approach combines newly collected data on parental preferences with administrative data from Los Angeles. The preference data allow us to account for selection into remote learning while also studying selection patterns and treatment effect heterogeneity. We find that the average effect of remote learning is negative (-0.14$\sigma$  for reading; -0.17$\sigma$ for math). Notably, we also find evidence of positive learning effects for children whose parents have the strongest demand for remote learning. Our results suggest that an important subset of students currently sorting into post-pandemic remote learning benefit from expanded choice.},

  title={Social Interactions, Information, and Preferences for Schools: Experimental Evidence from Los Angeles},
  author={Campos, Christopher},
  abstract={This paper measures parents' beliefs about school and peer quality, how information about school and peer quality affects parents' school choices, and how social interactions mediate these effects. In a field experiment, parents were randomly given information on school quality and peer quality, with varying proximity to other parents who received similar information. Results show that parents typically underestimate school quality and overestimate peer quality. When both parents and their neighbors received information, preferences shifted toward higher value-added schools. These findings suggest substantial information spillovers, leading to increased enrollment in effective schools. Enrollment in more effective schools leads to improved socio-emotional outcomes not captured by standardized exams. This evidence suggests that the intervention did more than alter educational pathways; it also played a critical role in shaping important developmental aspects of students' lives.},

  title={The Impact of Public School Choice: Evidence from Los Angeles' Zones of Choice},
  author={Campos, Christopher and Kearns, Caitlin},
  abstract={Does a school district that expands school choice provide better outcomes for students than a neighborhood-based assignment system? This paper studies the Zones of Choice (ZOC) program, a school choice initiative of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) that created small high school markets in some neighborhoods but left attendance-zone boundaries in place throughout the rest of the district. We study market-level impacts of choice on student achievement and college enrollment using a differences-in-differences design. Student outcomes in ZOC markets increased markedly, narrowing achievement and college enrollment gaps between ZOC neighborhoods and the rest of the district. The effects of ZOC are larger for schools exposed to more competition, supporting the notion that competition is a key channel. Demand estimates suggest families place substantial weight on schools' academic quality, providing schools with competition-induced incentives to improve their effectiveness. The evidence demonstrates that public school choice programs have the potential to improve school quality and reduce neighborhood-based disparities in educational opportunity.},
